# BlackJack

Program that simulates the blackjack card game with the most basic of rules (no splitting or other such rules). 

The program itself relies on a Cards class (which is also included in this repository), which means that two separate files are needed to run this program.

Code can certainly be polished and refactored to increase readability and/or efficiency, but at the very least, the game is functional and can be played by two or more people.
